If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once. Also, if a number is negative, retu

Sample Tests:

import codewars_test as test
from solution import solution

@test.describe("Fixed Tests")
def fixed_tests():
    @test.it("should handle basic cases")
    def basic_tests():
        test.assert_equals(solution(10), 23)
